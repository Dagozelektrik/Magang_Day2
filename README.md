# C++ and OOP Assignment

This assignment aims to help you understand C++ and OOP concepts by completing various tasks. First, explain what C++ is, its importance, and its advantages over other languages. Discuss preprocessing, compilation, and linking stages, then write functions to add integers and floating-point numbers, and create a for loop to print numbers 1 to 10. Next, write a C++ program simulating a car moving `n` units to the right each iteration with random noise, stopping when it reaches the target `xo`. Explain OOP concepts, including visibility, and the differences between `struct` and `class`. Write a class with a constructor, destructor, and copy constructor, and overload the `+` operator. Finally, create a `Robot` class with position, orientation attributes, and movement methods, including a static member to count `Robot` objects. Submit well-organized code files with comments, ensuring proper use of OOP concepts and C++ syntax. Good luck!
